# Real-Time Rule Engine with AST

This repository hosts the **Real-Time Rule Engine with Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**, a Python-based project for creating, combining, modifying, and evaluating dynamic rules using ASTs. This rule engine allows flexible, condition-based decision-making that can be easily modified to accommodate changing business logic requirements.

## Project Overview
The Rule Engine utilizes an AST to process and evaluate conditional expressions against a user data dictionary. It supports operators (`AND`, `OR`) and allows combination and modification of multiple rules.

## Features
- **AST Generation**: Converts rule strings into an AST structure.
- **Rule Combination**: Combines multiple ASTs into one using specified logic.
- **Rule Evaluation**: Evaluates the AST against user data.
- **Rule Modification**: Modifies specific conditions within an AST.
- **MongoDB Compatibility**: Provides a sample MongoDB schema for storing rule structures.

```

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or later
- Git
- MongoDB (optional, for schema example)

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shubhangiwartale/Real-Time-Rule-Engine.git
cd Real-Time-Rule-Engine
```

### Install Dependencies
Create a virtual environment and install any dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt  # If a requirements file is provided
```

## Usage

### Basic Rule Creation
To create an AST from a rule string:
```python
from rule_engine import create_rule

rule = "((age > 30 AND department = 'Sales') OR (salary > 50000))"
ast = create_rule(rule)
```

### Rule Combination
Combine multiple rules using `AND` or `OR` logic.
```python
from rule_engine import combine_rules

ast_combined = combine_rules([ast_rule1, ast_rule2])
```

### Rule Evaluation
Evaluate the AST against a sample user data dictionary.
```python
from rule_engine import evaluate_rule

user_data = {
    'age': 35,
    'department': 'Sales',
    'salary': 60000
}

result = evaluate_rule(ast_combined, user_data)
print("Evaluation Result:", result)
```

### Rule Modification
Modify specific conditions in an existing rule.
```python
from rule_engine import modify_rule

modify_rule(ast_combined, "age > 30", "age > 40")
```

## Examples
See `examples/example_usage.py` for detailed usage and more examples of combining, evaluating, and modifying rules.

## MongoDB Schema Example
An example schema for storing rules in MongoDB:
```json
{
    "rule_id": "rule1",
    "root": {
        "type": "operator",
        "value": "AND",
        "left": {
            "type": "operand",
            "value": "age > 30"
        },
        "right": {
            "type": "operator",
            "value": "OR",
            "left": {
                "type": "operand",
                "value": "salary > 50000"
            },
            "right": {
                "type": "operand",
                "value": "experience > 5"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Future Enhancements
- **Support for Additional Operators**: Add support for more complex logical operations.
- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling for invalid input formats.
- **Database Integration**: Extend support for additional database types.
